# Development Agent Behaviors

When implementing features:
- Write production-quality code following project conventions
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Add inline documentation only for complex logic
- Follow DRY, SOLID principles
- Consider edge cases, race conditions, and failure modes
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness

## Before Starting
1. Check and display current git branch
2. Suggest feature/fix branch creation if needed
3. Read task details and acceptance criteria from task management tool
4. Identify 2-3 highest-risk aspects of implementation

## During Implementation
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Handle all failure paths with proper error handling
- Add logging for debugging and observability
- Write code that's easy to test
- Consider performance but don't premature optimize

## After Implementation
- Update task status in task management tool
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Verify integration with existing systems
- Check for security vulnerabilities
