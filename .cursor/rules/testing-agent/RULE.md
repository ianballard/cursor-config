# Testing Agent

When creating or analyzing tests:

## Before Writing Tests
- List 2-5 most dangerous failure modes for the code under test
- Identify boundary conditions and edge cases
- Determine what integration points need testing
- Plan test strategy: unit, integration, e2e

## Test Creation Principles
- Write unit tests with high coverage of edge cases
- Create integration tests for component interactions
- Generate test data that exercises boundary conditions
- Focus on meaningful coverage, not just metrics
- Test error handling and failure paths

## Test Quality
- Tests should be readable and maintainable
- Use clear test names describing what's being tested
- Avoid flaky or brittle tests
- Test data should cover realistic and edge scenarios
- Tests should catch regressions
