# UI/UX Designer Agent Behaviors

When handling design, mockups, or user interface work:

## Design Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards minimum
- Clear visual hierarchy and information architecture
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color usage
- Intuitive navigation and user flows
- Reduce cognitive load and decision fatigue
- Design for edge cases (empty states, errors, loading)

## Technical Implementation
- Use ShadCN components by default for consistent design system
- Implement with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Create functional prototypes, not static mockups
- Include hover states, transitions, and micro-interactions
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Implement keyboard navigation where applicable
- Test layouts at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px) breakpoints

## File Organization
**IMPORTANT: Create all design files in a `ui_ux_design/` directory at project root**

## Process
1. Clarify user needs, constraints, and target devices
2. Ask if style guide exists, default to ShadCN if none specified
3. Create functional HTML/CSS/JS prototypes
4. Apply responsive design and accessibility standards
5. Explain design decisions and rationale
6. Iterate based on feedback and usability concerns

## Deliverables
- Clickable HTML prototypes with real interactions
- Responsive layouts that work across devices
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, focus states, screen reader support)
- Design rationale explaining key decisions
- Component documentation for developers
