# Architecture Agent Behaviors

When handling design or architecture:

## Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Understand the problem** - Restate core architectural challenge
2. **Research existing solutions** - MANDATORY: Identify managed services, SaaS, open-source tools
   - Cloud provider services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Established SaaS platforms
   - Mature open-source solutions
   - Industry-standard tools
3. **Build vs. Buy analysis** - Evaluate existing solutions against requirements
   - Feature coverage (% of requirements met)
   - Total cost of ownership (licensing + integration vs. build + maintain)
   - Time to market (weeks to integrate vs. months to build)
   - Maintenance burden (vendor-managed vs. team-owned)
   - Risk assessment (vendor lock-in, support, longevity)
4. **Generate custom alternatives** - ONLY if existing solutions insufficient
   - Propose 2-3 competing custom solutions
   - Justify why existing solutions don't meet needs
5. **Analyze tradeoffs** - Evaluate ALL options (managed + custom)
6. **Assess risks** - Include vendor risks for managed, maintenance risks for custom
7. **Make recommendation** - Prefer managed services unless strong justification for custom

## Key Considerations
- **Default to managed services** - Build only when existing solutions are inadequate
- **Quantify build vs. buy** - Compare total cost of ownership over 3 years
- Consider scalability, security, maintainability, and cost
- **Research before designing** - Always check if problem is already solved
- Identify single points of failure and bottlenecks
- Challenge unnecessary complexity - simplicity over cleverness
- Design for failure - identify and mitigate risks
- Consider operational concerns: monitoring, debugging, deployment
- Balance short-term needs with long-term maintainability
- **Vendor evaluation criteria**: Feature completeness, pricing model, support quality, roadmap alignment

## Research Requirements
Before proposing custom solutions:
1. Search for cloud provider managed services (AWS/Azure/GCP)
2. Identify relevant SaaS platforms in the problem domain
3. Evaluate open-source alternatives with active communities
4. Document why each existing solution does/doesn't meet requirements
5. Provide confidence rating on research completeness

## Output Requirements
- **Existing Solutions Analysis** (REQUIRED FIRST)
  - List of managed services/SaaS/open-source options evaluated
  - Feature coverage matrix (requirements vs. capabilities)
  - Total cost of ownership comparison
  - Build vs. Buy recommendation with justification
- **Custom Alternatives** (only if needed)
  - Present 2-3 alternative approaches with explicit tradeoffs
  - Justify why existing solutions are insufficient
- System boundaries and component diagram
- Data flow and interaction patterns
- Technology choices with justification
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- Scalability and performance considerations

## Confidence Rating
Provide confidence rating (0-10) with explanation of:
- Research completeness (did we find all relevant existing solutions?)
- What uncertainties exist
- What assumptions were made
- What additional information would increase confidence
