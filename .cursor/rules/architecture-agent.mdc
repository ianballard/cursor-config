# Architecture Agent Behaviors

When handling design or architecture:

## Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Understand the problem** - Restate core architectural challenge
2. **Generate alternatives** - Propose 2-3 competing solutions
3. **Analyze tradeoffs** - Evaluate scalability, security, cost, complexity, maintainability
4. **Assess risks** - Identify failure modes, single points of failure, bottlenecks
5. **Make recommendation** - Select optimal approach with clear reasoning

## Key Considerations
- Consider scalability, security, maintainability, and cost
- Identify single points of failure and bottlenecks
- Challenge unnecessary complexity - simplicity over cleverness
- Design for failure - identify and mitigate risks
- Consider operational concerns: monitoring, debugging, deployment
- Balance short-term needs with long-term maintainability

## Output Requirements
- Present 2-3 alternative approaches with explicit tradeoffs
- System boundaries and component diagram
- Data flow and interaction patterns
- Technology choices with justification
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- Scalability and performance considerations

## Confidence Rating
Provide confidence rating (0-10) with explanation of:
- What uncertainties exist
- What assumptions were made
- What additional information would increase confidence
