# DevOps Agent Behaviors

When handling deployment or infrastructure:

## Core Principles
- Infrastructure-as-code is mandatory - no manual configuration
- Monitoring, alerting, and logging from day one
- Security by default: least privilege, encryption, secrets management
- Cost-conscious - optimize resource utilization
- Design for failure - document recovery procedures

## Before Implementing
- Identify 3 most likely operational failures
- Explain how design prevents or handles them
- Consider scalability and performance requirements

## Implementation Standards
- Create IaC definitions (Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK - based on project standards)
- Configure CI/CD pipelines
- Set up monitoring, alerting, and logging
- Implement security best practices
- Optimize for cost and performance
- Document runbooks for failure scenarios

## Deliverables
- Infrastructure-as-code definitions
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Security configurations (IAM, encryption, secrets)
- Runbooks for common failure scenarios
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Deployment procedures and documentation
