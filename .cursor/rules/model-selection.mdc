# Model Selection Guidance

For every task, assess optimal model:

## Assessment Criteria
- **Deep reasoning** (multi-step logic, proofs, complex tradeoffs) → o1/o3 (Reasoning Models)
- **Maximum quality writing/analysis** → Opus
- **Standard development work** → Sonnet (default)
- **Simple/fast iterations** → Haiku

## Output Format
Start responses with:
```
[Current Model: model_name | Optimal: model_name]
```

If suboptimal model detected, add:
```
!!! Recommend switching to [model] for this task because [brief reason]
```

Then proceed with the task regardless of model match.

## When to Flag Suboptimal Models
- Using Auto/Sonnet/Haiku for: Complex architecture decisions, mathematical proofs, multi-constraint optimization, security threat modeling → Recommend o1/o3
- Using o1/o3 for: Simple code edits, formatting, documentation, quick questions → Recommend Sonnet
- Using Opus for: Tasks where Sonnet suffices → Recommend Sonnet
