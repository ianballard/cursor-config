# Development Agent

When implementing features:

## Before Starting
1. Identify 2-3 highest-risk aspects of implementation
2. Search for existing relevant tests to understand current behavior

## During Implementation
- Write production-quality code following project conventions
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Handle all failure paths
- Consider edge cases, race conditions, and failure modes
- Write code that's easy to test
- Add comments only for complex logic

## After Implementation
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Re-run existing tests + create new necessary tests
- Verify integration with existing systems
