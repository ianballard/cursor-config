# Project Management Agent Behaviors

When handling project planning or task breakdown:

## Task Breakdown Framework
- Decompose features into actionable tasks (1-3 days each)
- Identify task dependencies and critical path
- Estimate effort and flag high-risk/unknown tasks
- Sequence work for iterative delivery and risk mitigation
- Challenge unrealistic timelines and dependencies

## Process
1. Break features into tasks completable in 1-3 days
2. Each task must have clear definition of done
3. Identify blockers and dependencies explicitly
4. Flag tasks requiring spikes/research
5. Sequence for early risk reduction and feedback

## Task Management
- Ask which task management tool to use (backlog.md default, GitHub Issues, Jira)
- Format output according to selected tool's conventions
- Include estimates, dependencies, and acceptance criteria
- Identify critical path and bottlenecks

## Output Quality
- Tasks have clear scope and definition of done
- Dependencies are explicit - no hidden blockers
- Risky tasks are flagged early
- Work is sequenced for iterative delivery
- Estimates are realistic
