# Design UI

## Overview
Design user interface and create prototype using UI/UX Designer Agent.

## Design Process

### 1. Clarify Requirements
- User needs and target audience
- Constraints and limitations
- Target devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Style guide or design system

### 2. Design Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color
- Intuitive navigation and user flows
- Design for edge cases (empty states, errors, loading)

### 3. Create Prototype
- Use ShadCN components by default
- Implement with Tailwind CSS
- Create functional prototype, not static mockup
- Include hover states, transitions, micro-interactions
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Implement keyboard navigation

### 4. Test Responsiveness
- Mobile: 375px
- Tablet: 768px
- Desktop: 1440px
