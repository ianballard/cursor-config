# Plan

Plan a feature from requirements to task breakdown.

Orchestrates multiple agents:
1. **Planning Agent** - Requirements, scope, acceptance criteria
2. **Architecture Agent** - Solution evaluation, build vs buy
3. **Planning Agent** - Task breakdown, estimates

## Usage
```
/plan user authentication with OAuth2
/plan BI assistant for QuickSight dashboards
```

Applies `planning-agent/RULE.md` and `architecture-agent/RULE.md` rules conditionally.
