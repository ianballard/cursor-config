# Plan Feature

## Overview
Systematically plan a new feature using Requirements, Architecture, and Project Management agents.

## Steps

1. **Gather Requirements** (Requirements Agent)
   - Define feature scope and goals
   - Identify functional and non-functional requirements
   - Create acceptance criteria
   - Flag any ambiguities or conflicts

2. **Design Architecture** (Architecture Agent)
   - Propose 2-3 architectural approaches
   - Analyze tradeoffs (scalability, security, cost, complexity)
   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies
   - Recommend optimal approach with confidence rating

3. **Break Down Work** (Project Management Agent)
   - Decompose into 1-3 day tasks
   - Identify dependencies and critical path
   - Estimate effort and flag risks
   - Sequence for iterative delivery

## Output
- Requirements document with acceptance criteria
- Architecture design with tradeoff analysis
- Task breakdown with estimates and dependencies
- Ready to start implementation
